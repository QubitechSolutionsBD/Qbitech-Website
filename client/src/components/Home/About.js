            We believe no matter what, you can't create an amazing software
            product without close cooperation between the Product Owner and the
            development team. Therefore, we see you as a crucial member of our
            Agile Team. That means you can expect full transparency in the
            project. As a Product Owner, you are always updated about the status
            of the development and have full control over the product.
